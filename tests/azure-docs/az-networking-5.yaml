testName: Azure Networking Questions
questions:
  - question: Can virtual networks be peered across different entra tenants?
    answer: >
      Yes, virtual networks (VNets) across different Microsoft Entra tenants can be peered. 

  - question: Can a virtual network span across multiple Azure regions?
    answer: >
      No, a single VNet is limited to one region.
      You can connect VNets from different regions with peering.

  - question: Is it possible to create multiple subnets within a single Azure VNet?
    answer: >
      Yes, you can define multiple subnets in one VNet.
      Each subnet must have a unique address range.

  - question: Does Azure reserve IP addresses in each subnet?
    answer: >
      Yes, it reserves five IP addresses per subnet.
      The first, last, and three additional addresses are reserved.

  - question: Can you peer two VNets with overlapping IP address ranges?
    answer: >
      No, overlapping address ranges are not supported for VNet peering.
      The IP spaces must be distinct.

  - question: Are user-defined routes (UDRs) mandatory in all Azure network setups?
    answer: >
      No, default system routes often suffice.
      UDRs are only needed for custom routing scenarios.
