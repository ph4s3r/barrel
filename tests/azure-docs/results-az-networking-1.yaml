candidate_answer: 'Based on the provided context, it is not possible to enable both
  ExpressRoute and VPN at the same time on the same VPN gateway. The context from
  "Azure Virtual Network FAQ" specifically mentions that a virtual network with both
  an ExpressRoute gateway and a VPN gateway is not supported for VPN gateway migration
  from classic to Resource Manager. This implies that having both simultaneously is
  not supported.
