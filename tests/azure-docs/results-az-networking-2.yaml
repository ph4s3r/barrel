question: Are user-defined routes (UDRs) mandatory in all Azure network setups?
reference_answer: 'No, default system routes often suffice. UDRs are only needed for
  custom routing scenarios.

  '
candidate_answer: "User-defined routes (UDRs) are not mandatory in all Azure network\
  \ setups. Azure provides default routes for traffic routing within virtual networks.\
  \ However, UDRs can be used to customize routing to meet specific requirements,\
  \ such as directing traffic through a network virtual appliance (NVA) or forcing\
  \ internet-bound traffic through an on-premises network for inspection and logging,\
  \ known as forced tunneling.\n\nFrom the context provided, it is clear that UDRs\
  \ are used to override Azure's default routing when specific routing behavior is\
  \ desired. For example, in the context of a virtual appliance scenario, UDRs are\
  \ used to ensure that communication is routed through the proper firewall appliance:\n\
  \n> \"Link each subnet in Azure to a route table to define how traffic initiated\
  \ in that subnet is routed. If no user-defined routes (UDRs) are defined, Azure\
  \ uses default routes to allow traffic to flow from one subnet to another.\"  \n\

  \  \n> **Metadata Header:** Virtual appliance scenario  \n> **Score:** 0.62098000\n\
  \nAdditionally, UDRs are used to customize routing for specific address prefixes,\
  \ as shown in the context about Azure virtual network traffic routing:\n\n> \"Azure\
  \ added this route when a UDR for the 10.0.0.0/16 address prefix was associated\
  \ to the Subnet1 subnet in the Virtual-network-1 virtual network.\"  \n> **Source:**\

  \  \n> **Metadata Header:** Virtual network traffic routing  \n> **Score:** 0.59344000\n\
  \nTherefore, while UDRs are not mandatory, they are a powerful tool for customizing\
  \ network traffic routing in Azure to meet specific requirements."

  not mandatory, provides correct reasoning about when UDRs are useful, and aligns
  well with the reference answer, which also mentions that default routes often suffice.
